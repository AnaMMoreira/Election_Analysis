## 1.  Overview of Election Audit

Tom, a Colorado Board of elections employee, has requested an audit of the tabulated election results for the U.S. Congressional Precinct in Colorado.  The task requested requires the total number of votes and their percentages for each candidate and the winning candidate.  Additionally, a summary based on counties within the precinct was requested and a breakdown of votes per county for identification of the largest county turnout was incorporated into the tool.  It had also been requested that the task be coded in Python in order to develop a tool that can be applied to other elections such as; other congressional districts, Senetorial districts, and local elections.  

In order to develop this tool the election results data was provided in a Comma Seperated Values (CSV) file called election_results.csv and is located in the Resource folder .  This data included all votes cast in the election; Mail-In_Ballot, Punch Cards, and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE counting machines) voting methods.  It contains 3 columns of information Balot ID, County, and Candidate. 

Seth, Tom's manager, would like him to become familiar with writing an running Python scripst using a command line, in order to make updates to GitHub repository. Using and understanding the Python script will allow Tom to perform future updates and election audits and analysis.  The Python code is found in the PyPoll_Challenge.py file and comments describing each data maniputation is cafully included so Tom or anyone looking at the code can easily follow and perhaps modify as needed.
